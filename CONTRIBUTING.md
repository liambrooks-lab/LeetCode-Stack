# Contribution Guidelines

This repository operates as an autonomous, highly optimized archive of algorithmic implementations. It is maintained under strict engineering standards. Contributions are not actively solicited, but pull requests (PRs) that demonstrate measurable improvements in system-level efficiency will be reviewed.

## I. Acceptance Criteria

Submissions must strictly align with the core language stack (C++, Python 3, JavaScript/Node.js) and fulfill at least one of the following technical requirements:

1. **Asymptotic Optimization:** The proposed solution must strictly reduce the upper bound time complexity (e.g., O(N^2) to O(N log N)) or optimal auxiliary space complexity.
2. **Architectural Parity:** Providing a missing implementation of a documented algorithm in one of the approved stack languages, adhering to memory and execution constraints.
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Introducing a mathematically or algorithmically superior approach (e.g., bitwise manipulation or greedy optimization replacing standard dynamic programming overhead).

## II. Submission Protocol

Strict adherence to the following workflow is mandatory. Non-compliant PRs will be automatically rejected and closed without review.

1. **Branching Strategy:** Fork the repository and branch directly from `main`.
2. **Execution Metrics:** The PR description must explicitly define the theoretical Time and Space complexities, alongside benchmarked execution metrics.
3. **Code Structure:** Implementations must be entirely self-contained. The use of external dependencies, standard library abstractions that hide heavy execution costs, or unnecessary modules is strictly prohibited.
4. **Commit Nomenclature:** Commits must follow standardized structural formatting indicating the paradigm and objective (e.g., `refactor(sliding-window): optimize space complexity to O(1)`).

## III. Pipeline Constraints

This repository is managed by an autonomous synchronization CI/CD pipeline. 
* Do **not** modify `README.md` or any architectural indices. 
* Do **not** alter the directory structure. 
The pipeline will autonomously process file indexing upon the successful merge of the execution script.
